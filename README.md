# ds3002_final
My final project using cloud services to demonstrate familiarity with MongoDB, Azure SQL Server, and creating fact tables.

The Databricks notebook is largely used to integrate with cloud services and create the dimension and fact tables, the Jupyter notebook is used to integrate real-time and static data, and to visualize the data.
